NU Ballroom Dance Clubâ€™s mission is to provide the entire Northeastern community
with free ballroom dance lessons in a comfortable, social, environment and the
opportunities to further their knowledge in all styles of ballroom dance! 

We offer:

* Beginner Lessons: These lessons are free, student run, and open to the entire
NU community. No partner? No dance shoes? No problem!  No prior dance experience
is necessary!

* Intermediate Lessons: These free lessons are catered towards those looking for
a more serious take on ballroom dance. We start with a warmup and review of the
beginner lesson, then professional instructors run an hour-long lesson anyone
who wants to take their ballroom skill up a notch. Intermediate lessons focus
on honing known moves and techniques while introducing higher level topics.
These lessons are recommended for those with beginner (Newcomer) experience in
the specified dance style.

* Competition Team: For those looking for a more competitive edge to their
dancing. See the Competition tab for more information on getting involved!

* Social Events:  Every year, NU Ballroom strives to offer the community more on
and and off campus events to ballroom dance and have a great time. Our events
are always free, have fun themes, and require no dancing experience! Past events
include Swing Night, Disco in the Dark, Salsa Night, and Yule Ball.
