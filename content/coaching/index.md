Studios and Anatoli Gorolevici of Eastern Ballroom Alliance.*

**Brad Lowe** has been studying and teaching ballroom dance for more than a decade.
While teaching at Fred Astaire Dance Studios, Brad received accolades as a
Regional Professional Smooth/Rhythm Finalist and a Regional Top 10 Teacher. His
passion for Latin then led him to Firebeat Dancesport Studios, where he quickly
achieved a new goal - Professional Latin Rising Star Finalist at Capital
Dancesport with his partner, Ching Kao. Brad enjoys teaching dancers of all
levels, from social and wedding couples to competitive Pro Am students. He is
thrilled to be working with the Northeastern University Ballroom Dance Club and
looks forward to helping NEU students achieve their dance goals.
