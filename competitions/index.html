<p>NUBDC prides itself in attending every ballroom competition it can in the
Boston area. A huge movement in this style of dance has swept over the
collegiate population and NUBDC is an up and coming contender, sending
increasing numbers each semester to compete against some of the biggest names
in collegiate ballroom.</p>

<p>NU Ballroom offers any and all of its members the opportunity to participate in
various competitions offered in both fall and spring semesters. NUBDC supports
a high level of newcomer and bronze level dancers and a growing number of
silver dancers and above who compete on a regular basis. Competitive members
are highly encouraged to attend advanced lessons as well as open floor
practices to improve their technique and skill. NUBDC encourages all new and
returning members to experience the fun and enriching atmosphere of competitive
ballroom dance.</p>

<p>Competing is a fantastic and unique opportunity to explore another iteration of
what ballroom dance has to offer, we highly recommend everyone try it out once!
We guarantee you’ll come back for more!! Talk to our Co-captains to learn more
about training &amp; competitions.</p>

<p>Questions? Check out the Competition FAQs section.</p>

<h2 id="competition-faq">Competition FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>​What does a competition entail?</strong></p>

<p>At a competition, dancers of all levels show their skill on the dance floor.
For each section announcers/signs will tell you which dance will be done next.
Before the dance, you and your peers will line up and wait until your heat is
called (heat is defined as: the group of multiple couples who dance the same
time as you do on the dance floor). When it is your heat&rsquo;s turn, you and your
partner will walk onto the floor and choose your spot. When the music starts,
you and your partner will have 90 seconds to show the judges your best moves,
excellent technique, and the dance&rsquo;s spirit (ex: happy for swing, angry for
tango). When the music stops you simply walk off the dance floor. After some
time signs will display the results or the announcer will call out who got
&ldquo;callbacks.&rdquo; If you and your partner get a callback then that means the judges
saw you dancing and thought you should make it to the next round.</p>

<p>If you are wondering what goes on at a competition for yourself but don&rsquo;t feel
ready to compete yet, all competitions allow spectators (though some do ask for
a $5-$15 fee). If room is available, co-captains will open an invitation for
spectators to travel with the competitors to the competition. If room is not
available, spectators are free to come as well but will have to find their own
transportation. Most competitions NUBDC takes part in can be accessed by MBTA
vehicles.</p>

<p><strong>​When is there time to train/practice for competition?</strong></p>

<p>Open floor for competition practices are available throughout the semester.
Open floor times are Saturdays from 11am - 1pm in Curry Studio B. Competitors
may also set up separate practice times with their partners in the dance
studios by going to the Student Activities Scheduling Desk on the 4th floor of
the Curry Student Center.</p>

<p>In addition, we hold an announced “mock competition” prior to each competition
in which we go over competition tactics, how to properly enter/exit the floor
along with a few other helpful tips!</p>

<p><strong>Do I have to compete in every competition?</strong></p>

<p>Competitive members are not required to compete in all competitions, but may
pick and choose the ones they would like to compete in.</p>

<p><strong>Do I have to dance every dance offered at a single competition?</strong></p>

<p>There is no requirement to compete in every dance offered in a given
competition. Some competitions will pair dances (i.e. waltz/foxtrot) in which
case you must dance both dances in the category.</p>

<p>It’s always easier to register for all dances and then whittle down the list as
you and your partner get closer to the competition date than try and add dances
later on.</p>

<p><strong>​Am I allowed to choose my partner?</strong>
Dancers can choose their own partners or seek help from the co-captains in
picking a dance partner.</p>

<p><strong>Do I have to have a partner before registering for a competition?</strong></p>

<p>No, you do not have to have a partner before registering for a competition
(although it may help so you can practice). The co-captains will list your
partner as “to be announced” or “TBA” until you find one. You can even find a
partner on the day of the competition from another school!!</p>

<p><strong>Do I have to dance with the same partner for an entire competition?</strong></p>

<p>While we recommend you stay with the same partner for all dances in a given
competition you are allowed to switch partners per category (i.e. Swing vs.
Cha-cha). You are not allowed to switch partners between rounds (i.e. Swing
round 1 vs. swing semi-final round) per competition rules.</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s my level?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Newcomer</em> - 1 semester dancing or less</li>
<li><em>Bronze</em> - 1 to 3 semesters dancing</li>
<li><em>Silver</em> - more than 3 semesters dancing until you place out</li>
<li><em>Gold</em> - after the silver level, you can only place into this level</li>
</ul>

<p>Your level may change from one competition to another, some use time-out dates
(per semester) to dictate which level you should compete at, while others have
place-out clauses (based on scoring). It is important to consult that
particular competition’s syllabus to find out exactly what they use. If you are
still unsure, please speak to our co-captains.</p>

<p><strong>​What is proper attire and footwear for competition?</strong></p>

<p>Proper attire varies in definition from one competition to the other as well as
per dance level and dance style. Traditional ballroom costumes may be worn for
levels Bronze and higher by both ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p><em>Gentlemen</em> should wear black dress pants, black socks, and black dress shoes
for all events. A white button down shirt is required for Smooth/Standard
dances. A black button down shirts (or a solid dark colored shirt) is required
for Latin/Rhythm Dances. Ties, Vests, Tuxes, etc. are optional but can be worn
at all levels.</p>

<p><em>Ladies</em> should have a short dress (knee length or higher) for Latin/Rhythm
dances and a long dress (calf to ankle length) dress for Smooth/Standard dances.
A worn-in pair of heels is the preferred footwear.</p>

<p>Shoes made for ballroom dance are not needed but heel taps are required for
followers at all levels. Heel taps can be purchased at competitions for $3-6.</p>

<p><strong>​How do I borrow costumes for competition?</strong></p>

<p>NUBDC has a closet of ballroom costumes, dresses, and shoes that are available
to all competitive members with the permission of the co-captains. Competitors
must approach one of the co-captains to gain access to items in the closet and
sign out whatever they borrow. Students are fully responsible for the well-being
of all NUBDC items in their possession. Any and all borrowed items may ONLY be
used for ballroom competition. Anything borrowed from the closet must be
returned at a date assigned by the co-captains.</p>

<p>Failure to adhere to these rules will result in the student no longer being
allowed to borrow items from the closet, expulsion from the student organization
and possible reprimand from Northeastern University.</p>

<p><strong>Should couples try and choreograph competition dances?</strong></p>

<p>Most newcomer, bronze, and silver competitors choose to do solely “lead-follow”
dancing which does not require choreography. In some of the higher levels of
dancing such as gold and open, choreography is more widely accepted. However,
some choreography is allowed at lower levels as long as all moves in the
choreographed piece meet the competition&rsquo;s specific syllabus restrictions.</p>

<p>Remember, no matter how choreographed a dance is, the leader must still lead
the follower through the dance.</p>

<p><strong>How does competition technique differ from social dance?</strong></p>

<p>Technique becomes more specific depending on the dance environment. Social
dancing is just for fun so the rules are not as strict or reinforced. Oftentimes
there are too many other couples on the floor at social dances for the elaborate
styling usually seen in competitive ballroom.</p>

<p>Judges look for more advanced technique from competitors. In a competition
setting, the movements are more elaborate and controlled. The leader is the one
responsible for all steps performed. The point of competitive technique is to
grab the judge’s attention for all the right reasons (floor craft, etiquette,
form and technique).</p>

<p>Specific technique for each dance will be taught at our intermediate and
advanced lessons or can be learned at studios outside of NUBDC.</p>
