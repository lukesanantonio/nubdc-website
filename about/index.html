    <p>NU Ballroom Dance Clubâ€™s mission is to provide the entire Northeastern community
with free ballroom dance lessons in a comfortable, social, environment and the
opportunities to further their knowledge in all styles of ballroom dance!</p>

<p>We offer:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Beginner Lessons: These lessons are free, student run, and open to the entire
NU community. No partner? No dance shoes? No problem!  No prior dance experience
is necessary!</p></li>

<li><p>Intermediate Lessons: These free lessons are catered towards those looking for
a more serious take on ballroom dance. We start with a warmup and review of the
beginner lesson, then professional instructors run an hour-long lesson anyone
who wants to take their ballroom skill up a notch. Intermediate lessons focus
on honing known moves and techniques while introducing higher level topics.
These lessons are recommended for those with beginner (Newcomer) experience in
the specified dance style.</p></li>

<li><p>Competition Team: For those looking for a more competitive edge to their
dancing. See the Competition tab for more information on getting involved!</p></li>

<li><p>Social Events:  Every year, NU Ballroom strives to offer the community more on
and and off campus events to ballroom dance and have a great time. Our events
are always free, have fun themes, and require no dancing experience! Past events
include Swing Night, Disco in the Dark, Salsa Night, and Yule Ball.</p></li>
